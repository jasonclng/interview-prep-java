<h1 align="center">Coding Interview Questions in Java</h1>

This project contains my solutions to <strong><a href="https://algoexpert.io">AlgoExpert</a></strong> problems. It demonstrates my ability to solve data structure and algorithm problems.

All the problems are written in Core Java without any specific framework or library. The same concepts/algorithms can be ported easily to other programming languages. I also provide the link for a similar problem in <strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a></strong> so that anyone can try it out!
